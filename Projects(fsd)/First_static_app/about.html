            AC's visit to the Canadian set of the Netflix apocalypse road movie How It Ends yielded our in-depth piece
            on the work of Peter Flinckenberg, FSC — who's pictured above — as well as that of director David M.
            Rosenthal and their intrepid crew. With the aid of a “Top Rider” stunt car, a follow bus carrying the
            production crew, and the latest remote-control technologies, the filmmakers captured all of the feature's
            driving scenes in-camera on real roads. They also made prolific use of Whitepoint Optics tilt-shift lenses
            for some beautiful and eerie exteriors.

            The latest entry in the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Ragnarok finds the god of thunder
            (portrayed by Chris Hemsworth) in a desperate fight to prevent the destruction of his home planet, Asgard.
            To complement AC's deep dive into the making of the movie with cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe, ASC,
            AEC; director Taika Waititi; and a number of their key collaborators — coverage that appears in our December
            2017 issue — we here present a visual walk-through of the production.
