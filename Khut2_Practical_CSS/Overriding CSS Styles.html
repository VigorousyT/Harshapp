 <!-- No effect   -->
 <!-- Here is a very simple CSS code in the style -->
 <!-- element. It targets an H1 element and changes the -->
 <!-- text color to red. We have also defined the color -->
 <!-- property on the H1 element using the style -->
 <!-- attribute. In this case, the color of the text will be -->
 <!-- green, and the style applied using the style -->
 <!-- element will be overridden by the styles applied -->
 <!-- with the style attribute. So, the inline styles have -->
 <!-- the highest priority. If the same style is defined in -->
 <!-- the style element and inline styles, the inline styles -->
 <!-- will work-->
                                         
     <!--  The inline style will override the style defined bythe stylesheet -->
     <!--  The inline styles have the highest priority -->
     <!--  If the same style is defined in the stylesheet and inline styles, the inline styles will work -->
