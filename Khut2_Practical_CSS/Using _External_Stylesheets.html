Advantages of using external stylesheets:

      Keeps the HTML file clean

      Separates the CSS styles from the HTML document

      CSS code can be broken down into multiple files

      Same CSS code can be used in multiple HTML documents

      Can make use of browser’s caching capabilities

      Makes it easier to manage large projects     -->

              The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around
              it, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. ...
              Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion
              miles (15 billion kilometers) from the sun.

              The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the
              objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects
              that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the
              remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar
              System bodies.
