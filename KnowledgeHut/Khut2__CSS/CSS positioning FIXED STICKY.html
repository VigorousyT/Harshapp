        <h1>Basics of Physics</h1>
        Physics is one of the broader subjects that fall under the category of
        Science. The main object of all the three division, Biology, Physics,
        and Chemistry are to understand the law of the universe and understand
        everything in it. Physics is concerned with every aspect of Universe. It
        is a scientific study that governs the physical world and natural
        phenomenon around us. It deals with matter and its relation to energy.
        Everything from the rainbow formation of eclipse occurrence to the
        falling of things from up to down ( gravity ), the cause of sunset or
        sunrise is all bound to have answers and Basic Physics states it all.
        Behind every question lies the four important aspect or terms to
        understand: Hypothesis, Model, Theory, and Law. Physics is complicated
        but it also relies on a number of the law of nature that is accepted on
        discoveries and inventions. Some of them include Sir Isaac Newton’s Law
        of Gravity as well as his Three Laws of Motion. Albert Einstein’s Theory
        of Relativity the laws of thermodynamics. The several branches of
        Physics are – Classical Mechanics Thermodynamics Electromagnetism
        Relativity Integrative Fields Physics uses the methods that are
        scientific to reveal the principles that govern light and matter and as
        well to discover the implications of those laws. Physics aims to
        describe the function of everything that is present around us with the
        movement of tiny charged particles to the motion of people, flights,
        care. Everything around us can be very accurately described by the law
        of physics. Physics is also about the study of nature and forces which
        are measured by the physical quantities. Gravity is one of the universal
        forces if nature that is a force acting upon all matters. The
        gravitational force between two objects is dependent on their masses.
        The first scientist to define the law of gravitation was Issac Newton.
        The law of gravitation states the gravity is strongest when between two
        huge objects and as and when those objects get apart, it gets much
        weaker. The interactions of the Universe are governed by the four forces
        including – Strong, Weak, Electromagnetic and Gravitational. Electric
        Current is another aspect of Physics which play a very important role.
        The continuous flow of electrons through a conducting material is known
        as electric current.

        <h1>Newton and Gravity</h1>
        Every one of us knows that ”Whatever goes up must come down”. Just like
        an apple falling from the tree or a pencil falling from the desk. But
        have you ever thought why do satellites don’t fall? The answer this is
        the universal law of gravitation. So whatever goes up must come down and
        might not come down too. Let us study this in detail. ”Every body in the
        universe attracts every other body with a force which is directly
        proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional
        to the square of the distance between them ”. That is if objects are
        very close to each other than the distance between them is less and so
        the force with which they attract each other will be more. Suppose you
        have a ball and a box both lying on the floor. Do they actually start
        moving towards each other? According to the universal law, the ball and
        the box should be moving towards each other. But in actual this does not
        happen. This is because the force with which they are attracting each
        other is very much small. So here if the mass of the ball is m1 and mass
        of the box is m2 then, F ∝ m1 m2, and is inversely proportional to the
        distance between them.

        <h1>Motion of the Earth</h1>
        Rotation and Revolution are two motions of the earth. When earth spins
        or rotates around its axis, that movement of spinning is called Rotation
        of Earth. And when earth spins or revolves around the sun, that movement
        is called Revolution of Earth. In this chapter, we will talk about the
        motions that our planet Earth has. We will discuss the various motions
        of the Earth and what that results in. By the end of the chapter, all
        your doubts would have been cleared! Earth basically has two types of
        motions. They are rotation and revolution. These two motions are
        responsible for different kinds of phenomena. Let us look into them in
        further detail.Rotation of the Earth Rotation is the movement of the
        earth on its axis. Days and Nights take place because of rotation. So,
        the days and nights that you see are actually because of this rotation
        of the earth around its own axis. The axis of the earth, which is an
        imaginary line, has axis tilted at an angle of 66.5 ° with its orbital
        plane. The circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called
        the circle of illumination. Revolution of the Earth Revolution is the
        second type of motion of the earth. It is the movement of the earth
        around the Sun in a fixed path or orbit. Revolution causes the change of
        seasons. It takes 365 days and 6 hours (one year) to revolve around the
        sun. It is important to note that we consider a year as consisting of
        365days only and ignore six hours for the sake of convenience.
