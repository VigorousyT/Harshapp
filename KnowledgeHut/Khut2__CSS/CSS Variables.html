      <h1>Galaxy</h1>
      A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants,
      interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from
      the Greek galaxias, literally "milky", a reference to the Milky Way.

      <div class="solar-system">
        <h2>Solar System</h2>
        The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the
        objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects
        that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets, with the
        remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar
        System bodies.

        <div class="planets">
          <h3>Planets</h3>
          A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant
          that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not
          massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared its
          neighbouring region of planetesimals.
