            <p>Nine noble families fight for control over the lands of Westeros, while an ancient enemy returns after being dormant for millennia.</p>
            
            <p>A popular misconception developed among viewers of the show that the show-runners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had rushed the making of the final season so that they could move on to make a Star Wars project for Disney. While they did have several Star Wars movies planned at the time of the airing of Season 8, Benioff and Weiss have stated that their plans for the remainder of Game of Thrones (ending with Season 8) were already mapped out in 2013, long before Disney approached them (who were still busy setting up Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens (2015) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) at the time). Also, their Star Wars project was only due to come out in 2022, and since the show wrapped filming in 2018, the production tables of both series were not even remotely overlapping. The shorter number of episodes in Season 8 notwithstanding, the production of these final six episodes took twice as much time as a regular old ten-episode season, so the production wasn't even expedited. On top of that, a few months after the show aired its final episode, Benioff and Weiss chose to sign a hundred-million dollar deal with Netflix that forced them to withdraw from the Star Wars project, citing that they didn't have time to do justice to both deals - indicating that the Star Wars project wasn't on high priority for them in the first place. </p>
